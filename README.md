## Projects

Here are some of my recent stuff:

### [Scraping for commercial data](https://github.com/juandelacuadra/Scraping_Web)

- This project focuses on developing a web scraping tool to gather commercial data from various sources. The tool utilizes techniques such as web crawling, data extraction, and data cleaning to collect and organize valuable information about businesses. The extracted data can be used for market analysis, lead generation, and other business insights. The project demonstrates the use of Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Requests for web scraping, as well as data manipulation techniques with Pandas.
